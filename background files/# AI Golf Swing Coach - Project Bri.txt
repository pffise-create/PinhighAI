# AI Golf Swing Coach - Project Brief

## Project Overview
Building a mobile app that provides AI-powered golf swing coaching through conversational analysis. The key differentiator is **root cause coaching** - identifying underlying swing fundamentals rather than just treating symptoms.

## Target Market
- **Primary users:** 8-25 handicap golfers
- **Pain point:** Traditional golf apps show swing data but don't provide actionable coaching
- **Value proposition:** "Fix one fundamental, improve three swing flaws"

## Core Product Flow
1. **Upload swing video** (30-60 seconds)
2. **AI analyzes** swing mechanics and identifies issues
3. **Conversational coaching** explains root causes and provides improvement guidance
4. **Follow-up chat** for questions and drill recommendations

## Key Differentiator: Root Cause Coaching
**Traditional approach:** "You're coming over the top and have early extension"
**Our approach:** "Your over-the-top move and early extension are both caused by poor weight shift. Fix that fundamental and both problems will improve."

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo) - cross-platform mobile app
- **Backend:** AWS serverless (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
- **AI:** GPT-4o for swing analysis and coaching conversations
- **Video processing:** Frame extraction and swing phase detection
- **Cost:** ~$0.03 per swing analysis

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Working)
- **Sprint 1:** React Native app UI/UX (professional design, navigation, mock functionality)
- **Sprint 2:** AWS backend infrastructure (video processing, 14 swing phases extraction)
- **AI Integration:** GPT-4o analysis pipeline (symptom detection â†’ root cause â†’ coaching)

### âŒ Missing (Current Blocker)
- **Mobile-Backend Connection:** React Native app can't actually upload videos or connect to AWS
- **Real functionality:** App is currently just UI shell with mock data

## Immediate Objective
Connect the working React Native UI to the working AWS backend so users can:
1. Record golf swing videos in the app
2. Upload to AWS for AI analysis
3. Receive personalized coaching in the chat interface

## Technical Implementation Needed
1. **Real video upload** from React Native to S3
2. **API Gateway endpoints** for mobile-AWS communication
3. **Results polling** to get AI analysis back to the app
4. **Chat integration** to display coaching responses

## Business Strategy
- **MVP validation:** Prove root cause coaching resonates with golfers
- **Premium positioning:** AI coaching justifies higher pricing vs basic swing apps
- **Viral potential:** Quality coaching drives word-of-mouth growth
- **Competitive moat:** Root cause methodology is difficult to replicate

## Success Metrics
- **Technical:** 30-60 second analysis time, 99% uptime
- **User experience:** Clear, actionable coaching that helps golfers improve
- **Business:** User retention and organic growth through coaching quality

## Development Context
- **Builder:** Technical product manager (can code, needs step-by-step guidance)
- **Environment:** Windows + PowerShell + Expo + React Native
- **Approach:** Focused sprint sessions with detailed implementation plans
- **Quality standard:** Production-ready, not prototype code
