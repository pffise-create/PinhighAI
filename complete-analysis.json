Notes below refer to the frame numbers you provided (000–009). I’ll focus only on what’s visible in this batch.\n\n1) Setup & Address (frames 000–001)\n- Posture: Athletic, but your upper back is a bit rounded and the hands sit slightly low/close to the thighs. You look a touch “tucked” under with the pelvis.\n- Stance/width: On the narrow side for a mid‑iron. Ball appears a fraction forward of center.\n- Alignment: Stick on the ground is good. Shoulders look a hair open to the target line (forearms/shaft point left of stick).\nActionable tweaks\n- Stand 1 inch farther from the ball and raise the handle slightly so the shaft angle matches your lead forearm more closely. Let the arms hang under the shoulders with a neutral, flatter upper‑back (sternum lifted).\n- Add ½–1 clubhead of stance width for irons; square the shoulder line to the ground stick.\n\n2) Takeaway & Backswing (frames 002–004)\n- Takeaway (002): Clubhead works outside the hands early with an abrupt wrist set, making the shaft more vertical than parallel to the target line at shaft‑parallel. Face looks slightly shut relative to your spine angle.\n- Mid‑backswing to top (003–004): Club finishes a touch across the line (pointing right of target) with the right leg straightening and pelvis level. Good turn, but the early steepness sets up a steeper transition.\nActionable cues\n- Feel “hands in, clubhead in” together for the first 18–24 inches. At shaft‑parallel (club roughly hip‑high), checkpoint: shaft parallel to the ground and to the target line, clubhead just outside the hands, toe slightly up (face matching spine angle).\n- Keep some flex in the trail knee and a bit more trail‑hip depth as you turn.\n\n3) Transition & Downswing (frames 004–006)\n- Transition (004–005): The shaft stays on the steeper side with minimal shallowing. Right elbow stays high a beat too long; trail heel begins to lift early.\n- Sequence: Arms/club start down before pressure clearly moves to the lead side, encouraging an over‑the‑top tendency.\nActionable cues\n- “Pressure then pivot then arms”: from the top, bump pressure to the lead foot (lead heel/lead hip) as the trail elbow works down in front of the ribcage. Keep the trail heel on the ground a fraction longer.\n- Feel the handle work down and slightly behind you while the chest stays closed a touch longer.\n\n4) Impact Zone (frame 006)\n- Body: Lead side posting up nicely, but trail heel is already off the ground which can stall rotation and send the path left.\n- Club delivery: With the steeper approach, face/path can get leftward. Handle is forward, but extension through the ball is limited (arms starting to fold quickly).\nActionable cues\n- Maintain side‑bend/tilt and rotate through with the handle leading, but keep both arms extending through waist‑high post‑impact.\n\n5) Follow‑Through (frames 007–009)\n- Finish: Balanced and tall; chest to target is good. Club exits high left (consistent with the steeper move). Trail foot up early.\nActionable cue\n- Feel a longer “hold the extension” to lead‑arm‑parallel post‑impact before the fold, with the club exiting more through your right shoulder instead of steep left.\n\nTargeted drills (do these with the alignment stick on the ground)\n- Shaft‑parallel checkpoint drill: Place a second stick 2–3 feet behind the ball parallel to target. Rehearse takeaways to hip‑high where the club matches that stick (parallel), toe slightly up. Film that checkpoint (frame 002 position).\n- Headcover gate (outside the ball): Put a headcover just outside the ball line at address. If you roll the clubhead outside early, you’ll hit it. Trains the “hands/club in” takeaway.\n- Pump‑and‑bump shallowing: Go to the top (004), then make three small “pumps” feeling pressure into the lead foot while the trail elbow drops and the shaft lays down, then swing through. Keep the trail heel down during the first pump.\n- Trail‑arm connection: Place a glove/towel under the trail armpit and keep it lightly pinned through the downswing to lead‑arm‑parallel after impact. Promotes shallowing and better extension.\n- Step‑through sequence drill: Make a backswing, then as the club changes direction, step the lead foot toward the target 4–6 inches and swing. Emphasizes pressure shift before the arms.\n\nKey feels to keep for batch 2 review\n- A calmer, more “in‑sync” takeaway to a neutral shaft‑parallel.\n- From the top, pressure left first, then let the right elbow pitch down while keeping the trail heel planted a beat longer.\n- Extend the arms through the strike before the finish.\n\nWe’ll refine ball flight and face control once we see the other frames/front view, but these changes will set up a shallower, more powerful delivery.\n\n---\n\n## Swing Phase Analysis 2 (Frames: frame_010)\n\nFrame_010 – Finish/Release Phase\n\nWhat’s good\n- Full rotation: Chest and belt buckle are facing the target, hands high with the shaft wrapped around the shoulders. That’s a sign you kept turning through the ball instead of stalling the body.\n- Weight shift: Trail heel is up and the majority of pressure appears to be on the lead side—good overall transfer.\n\nOpportunities\n- Lead-foot pressure and balance: Your mass looks a bit forward over the toes. Aim for pressure more into the lead heel at finish to avoid “tip-toe” balance and to protect the lower back.\n- Trail-foot action: The trail foot is up (good), but make sure it’s “banked” on the inside edge before it comes to the toe. Spinning to the toe too early can push the path left and cost compression.\n- Spine/hip finish: There’s a hint of reverse-C (lumbar arch). Excess extension can stress the back and usually means the pelvis pushed toward the ball line. Try to finish tall with ribs stacked over pelvis.\n\nSimple checkpoints for this phase\n- Hold the finish for 3 seconds. You should feel ~90% pressure in the lead heel, trail toe lightly on the ground, knees facing target, and you could lift the trail foot without falling.\n- Club across the lead shoulder with the handle outside the lead ear, not behind the head.\n- Head and sternum stacked over the lead foot—no lean toward the ball or excessive arch.\n\nTargeted drills\n- Lead-heel finish drill: Hit half-to-3/4 shots focusing on “heel, not toe” at finish. Exaggerate feeling the lead heel screwed into the turf as you hold your pose.\n- Bank-the-trail-foot: Place a headcover under the outside of the trail foot. Make swings keeping the inside edge of that foot down through impact, then allow it to release to the toe late.\n- Tall finish rehearsal: Without a ball, swing to a finish and squeeze glutes lightly to tuck the pelvis under. Feel ribs stacked over hips, not arched. Hold for 3 counts.\n\nIf you pair these finish cues with solid post-impact extension (arms long past the ball before folding), you’ll stabilize direction and contact while reducing back stress.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nBased on the complete 11-frame sequence analysis, the key areas for improvement span the entire swing motion. Focus on the specific technical points highlighted in each phase above for comprehensive swing development.\n\n","coaching_response":"# Golf Swing Analysis - Complete Sequence\n\n*Analysis based on 11 frames processed in 2 batches*\n\n## Swing Phase Analysis 1 (Frames: frame_000, frame_001, frame_002, frame_003, frame_004, frame_005, frame_006, frame_007, frame_008, frame_009)\n\nThanks for the clear down‑the‑line sequence.
