# Sprint 3B: Enhanced Follow-up API with Context Integration

**Project:** Golf Coach AI - Smart Coaching Conversation Architecture  
**Sprint:** 3B  
**Duration:** Week 3, Part B  
**Dependencies:** Sprint 3A (Context-Aware Chat API), existing golf-ai-analysis Lambda

## üéØ Business Problem Statement

**Current Follow-up System Limitations:**
- Existing follow-up API in golf-ai-analysis Lambda provides isolated swing-specific Q&A
- No integration with broader coaching conversation system
- Follow-up responses don't reference coaching history or relationship
- Missing connection between swing-specific discussions and overall coaching themes

**Business Value:**
- Unified coaching experience where swing follow-ups connect to broader coaching relationship
- Context-aware responses that reference both current swing and coaching history
- Seamless integration between swing analysis and ongoing coaching conversations
- Enhanced user experience with coaching continuity across all interactions

## üìã Implementation Requirements

### 1. ENHANCE REQUEST PROCESSING
- Accept enhanced context in follow-up requests
- Integrate with coaching-conversations table for context
- Reference current swing analysis + broader coaching themes
- Maintain swing-specific focus while adding coaching continuity

### 2. CONTEXT ASSEMBLY ENHANCEMENT
```javascript
// Enhanced follow-up context structure
const followUpContext = {
  currentSwing: {
    analysis_id: requestData.jobId,
    analysis_data: currentSwingAnalysis,
    key_focus: swingFocusArea,
    strengths: identifiedStrengths
  },
  coachingContext: {
    conversation_id: userConversationId,
    recent_messages: lastConversationMessages,
    coaching_themes: currentCoachingThemes,
    session_count: totalSessions,

  },
  userProfile: {
    user_id: requestData.userId,
    handicap: userHandicap,
    experience_level: userLevel,
    goals: userGoals
  }
};
```

### 3. GPT-4O PROMPT ENHANCEMENT

- Graceful degradation when coaching context unavailable
- Swing-specific error responses that maintain coaching tone
- Integration error handling between systems

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration Enhancement
```javascript
// Add coaching-conversations table access
const coachingConversationsTable = 'coaching-conversations';

// Enhanced follow-up function
async function handleEnhancedFollowUp(requestData) {
  try {
    // Get current swing context
    const swingContext = await getCurrentSwingContext(requestData.jobId);
    
    // Get coaching conversation context
    const coachingContext = await getCoachingContext(requestData.userId);
    
    // Assemble comprehensive context
    const fullContext = assembleFollowUpContext(swingContext, coachingContext);
    
    // Generate context-aware response
    const response = await generateCoachingFollowUp(fullContext, requestData.question);
    
    // Store follow-up in conversation history
    await storeFollowUpWithContext(requestData.userId, response, requestData.jobId);
    
    return response;
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Enhanced follow-up error:', error);
    // Fallback to basic follow-up
    return await handleBasicFollowUp(requestData);
  }
}
```

### Context Assembly Logic
```javascript
async function assembleFollowUpContext(swingContext, coachingContext) {
  return {
    contextType: 'swing_followup',
    currentSwing: {
      analysisId: swingContext.analysis_id,
      overallScore: swingContext.ai_analysis?.overall_score || 'N/A',
      keyFindings: swingContext.ai_analysis?.symptoms_detected || [],
      recommendations: swingContext.ai_analysis?.practice_recommendations || [],
      timestamp: swingContext.created_at
    },
    coachingRelationship: {
      sessionCount: coachingContext?.coaching_themes?.session_count || 1,
      primaryFocus: coachingContext?.coaching_themes?.primary_focus || 'initial_assessment',
      recentProgress: coachingContext?.coaching_themes?.recent_improvements || [],
      conversationHistory: coachingContext?.recent_messages?.slice(-5) || []
    },
    integrationMetadata: {
      hasCoachingHistory: !!coachingContext,
      contextQuality: calculateContextQuality(swingContext, coachingContext),
      responseStrategy: determineResponseStrategy(swingContext, coachingContext)
    }
  };
}
```

### Enhanced Prompt Engineering
```javascript
const enhancedFollowUpPrompt = `
You are continuing a coaching conversation about a specific swing analysis. 

COACHING RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT:
Session Count: ${coachingContext.sessionCount}
Primary Focus: ${coachingContext.primaryFocus}
Recent Progress: ${coachingContext.recentProgress.join(', ')}
Previous Discussions: ${coachingContext.conversationHistory.map(m => m.content).join('\n')}

CURRENT SWING ANALYSIS:
Overall Score: ${currentSwing.overallScore}/10
Key Findings: ${currentSwing.keyFindings.join(', ')}
Recommendations: ${currentSwing.recommendations.join(', ')}

FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:
"${userQuestion}"

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. Address the specific swing question directly
2. Reference our coaching relationship naturally ("As we've been working on...")
3. Connect to broader coaching themes when relevant
4. Maintain encouraging, supportive tone
5. Build on previous sessions without overwhelming with history
6. Provide actionable advice specific to their swing

Provide a response that feels like a continuation of our ongoing coaching relationship while focusing on their specific question about this swing.
`;
```

### Integration with Coaching Conversations
```javascript
async function storeFollowUpWithContext(userId, response, swingId) {
  try {
    // Store in swing analysis record
    await updateSwingAnalysisWithFollowUp(swingId, response);
    
    // Store in coaching conversations
    await storeInCoachingConversations(userId, {
      message: response,
      type: 'swing_followup',
      swingReference: swingId,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
    // Update coaching themes based on discussion
    await updateCoachingThemes(userId, response, swingId);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to store follow-up with context:', error);
    // Continue without storage - don't fail user request
  }
}

async function updateCoachingThemes(userId, response, swingId) {
  // Extract themes from the coaching response
  const themes = extractThemesFromResponse(response);
  
  // Update coaching conversation record
  await dynamodb.updateItem({
    TableName: 'coaching-conversations',
    Key: { conversation_id: `conv_${userId}` },
    UpdateExpression: 'ADD referenced_swings :swing SET coaching_themes.session_count = coaching_themes.session_count + :inc',
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
      ':swing': new Set([swingId]),
      ':inc': 1
    }
  }).promise();
}
```
