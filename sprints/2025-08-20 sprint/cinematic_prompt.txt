CONTEXT: I'm enhancing my existing React Native (Expo) golf coaching app's sign-in screen to have a premium cinematic video background while maintaining all current authentication functionality. The goal is to create a high-end app experience like Netflix or Master Class.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- React Native app with Expo
- Project location: C:\Users\pffis\Documents\ReactNativeProjects\GolfCoachExpoFixed
- Videos location: C:\Users\pffis\Documents\ReactNativeProjects\GolfCoachExpoFixed\stock videos\
- App uses existing theme in src/utils/theme.js (Golf club aesthetic)
- Current sign-in screen needs to be enhanced, not replaced

OBJECTIVE: Transform the existing sign-in screen into a cinematic experience with video backgrounds while preserving all authentication functionality.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. ENHANCE EXISTING SIGN-IN SCREEN:
   - Keep all current sign-in/login functionality intact
   - Add full-screen video background with cinematic effects
   - Apply proper overlays/gradients for text readability
   - Maintain all existing form fields and buttons

2. VIDEO BACKGROUND SYSTEM:
   - Use react-native-video for auto-playing background videos
   - Landscape videos with resizeMode="cover" for mobile
   - Ken Burns effect: slow zoom from scale(1) to scale(1.15) over 12 seconds
   - Cycle through 3 videos every 6-8 seconds with smooth transitions
   - Videos: muted, looping, optimized for mobile performance

3. OVERLAY/FILTER STRATEGY FOR READABILITY:
   - Dark gradient overlay (40-60% opacity) over videos
   - Additional blur or darkening behind text areas
   - Semi-transparent background cards for form elements
   - Ensure high contrast for all text and buttons
   - Test readability across all 3 video backgrounds

4. PREMIUM VISUAL DESIGN:
   - Glassmorphism effects on form containers
   - Subtle backdrop blur behind authentication cards
   - Enhanced shadows and depth
   - Premium button styling with proper contrast
   - Professional typography hierarchy

5. INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGING:
   - Rotate inspiring messages with video changes:
     * "Every great round starts with a single swing"
     * "Master the fundamentals, master the game"
     * "Transform your swing, transform your scores"
   - Position messaging to not interfere with sign-in forms

6. ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Smooth entrance animations for all elements
   - Ken Burns slow zoom on video backgrounds
   - Fade transitions between videos
   - Button press feedback animations
   - Form field focus animations

7. AUTHENTICATION FUNCTIONALITY TO PRESERVE:
   - All existing sign-in/login forms and validation
   - Navigation to main app after successful auth
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Any existing social login integrations
   - "Remember me" or similar features

8. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Ensure videos don't impact app performance
   - Handle video loading states gracefully
   - Optimize overlay transparency for both light/dark videos
   - Test on both iOS and Android
   - Ensure keyboard doesn't break layout

FILES TO EXAMINE AND MODIFY:
- Find and enhance the existing sign-in/login screen
- Install react-native-video if not already present
- Reference videos from ./stock videos/ folder
- Maintain integration with existing navigation

OVERLAY BEST PRACTICES:
- Use gradient overlays that are darker at bottom (where forms are)
- Apply backdrop-filter blur effects behind form containers
- Use semi-transparent cards with subtle borders
- Ensure minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text readability
- Test overlay effectiveness across all 3 video backgrounds

DELIVERABLES:
1. Enhanced existing sign-in screen with cinematic backgrounds
2. Proper overlay/filter implementation for text readability
3. Package.json updates for any new dependencies
4. Video integration and optimization
5. Testing checklist for readability and performance

GOAL: Transform the current functional sign-in screen into a premium, cinematic experience that makes users feel like they're using a high-end golf coaching platform, while maintaining all existing authentication functionality and ensuring perfect text readability.

Please examine the existing sign-in screen and enhance it with these cinematic video backgrounds and premium overlays.
