## Implementation Steps

### Step 3A: Coaching Insights Aggregation Service
**Claude-Code Prompt:**
```
CONTEXT: You are creating a service that analyzes all user chat history and video analyses to extract coaching insights. This service will aggregate data to identify consistent strengths, recurring improvement areas, and effective drill recommendations for display on the Coaching Summary page.

DATA SOURCES:
- Chat history from ChatHistoryManager
- Video analysis results from previous swing analyses
- User interaction patterns and coaching responses
- Progress trends over time

AGGREGATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. STRENGTHS IDENTIFICATION: Consistent positive feedback across analyses
2. IMPROVEMENT AREAS: Recurring coaching themes and problem areas
3. DRILL EFFECTIVENESS: Most recommended and successful practice drills
4. PROGRESS TRACKING: Improvement trends and coaching milestones
5. COACHING THEMES: Primary focus areas from conversations

ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS:
```javascript
class CoachingInsightsAggregator {
  static async generateCoachingSummary(userId) {
    const chatHistory = await ChatHistoryManager.loadConversation(userId);
    const videoAnalyses = await getVideoAnalysisHistory(userId);
    
    return {
      topStrengths: await extractConsistentStrengths(chatHistory, videoAnalyses),
      topImprovements: await identifyRecurringIssues(chatHistory, videoAnalyses),
      recommendedDrills: await aggregateEffectiveDrills(chatHistory, videoAnalyses),
      progressMetrics: await calculateProgressTrends(videoAnalyses),
      coachingThemes: await extractCoachingThemes(chatHistory)
    };
  }
}
```

INSIGHT EXTRACTION METHODS:
- Text analysis of coaching responses for recurring themes
- Sentiment analysis for strengths vs improvement language
- Frequency analysis of mentioned techniques and drills
- Progress trend calculation across video analyses
- Coaching effectiveness measurement

DATA PROCESSING:
- Weight recent data more heavily than older data
- Filter out inconsistent or one-off mentions
- Prioritize insights with high confidence scores
- Aggregate similar coaching concepts together
- Generate user-friendly summaries

ERROR HANDLING:
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully
- Provide fallback insights for new users
- Validate data integrity before processing
- Log processing errors for debugging
- Return partial results if some data unavailable

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/services/coachingInsightsAggregator.js
- src/utils/textAnalysisHelpers.js
- src/utils/progressCalculations.js

DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete coaching insights aggregation service
2. Strengths identification algorithms
3. Improvement areas detection
4. Drill effectiveness analysis
5. Progress tracking calculations
6. Error handling and data validation

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Accurately identifies consistent strengths across sessions
- Detects recurring improvement areas from conversations
- Recommends relevant and effective practice drills
- Calculates meaningful progress metrics
- Handles edge cases and missing data gracefully
```

### Step 3B: Coaching Summary Screen Interface

    </SummaryHeader>
    
    {/* New user experience */}
    {videoCount === 0 && (
      <NewUserPreview 
        message="Upload a swing video to see your personalized coaching insights here!"
        previewInsights={sampleInsights}
      />
    )}
    
    {videoCount === 1 && (
      <FirstSwingInsights 
        analysis={firstVideoAnalysis}
        encouragement="Great start! More videos will unlock detailed progress tracking."
      />
    )}
    
    {/* Full experience for multiple videos */}
    {videoCount > 1 && (
      <>
        <StrengthsCard strengths={insights.topStrengths} />
        
        <ImprovementAreasCard 
          areas={insights.topImprovements}
          priority={insights.improvementPriority}
        />
