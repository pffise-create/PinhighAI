### Step 5B: Performance Optimization & Final Polish
**Claude-Code Prompt:**
```
CONTEXT: You are performing final performance optimization and UX polish for the golf coaching app. This includes memory management, loading optimization, smooth animations, and ensuring production-ready performance across all features.

OPTIMIZATION AREAS:
1. MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Efficient handling of videos, chat history, images
2. LOADING PERFORMANCE: Fast app startup, lazy loading, caching strategies
3. ANIMATION POLISH: Smooth transitions between screens and states
4. ERROR HANDLING: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
5. PRODUCTION READINESS: Performance monitoring, crash reporting

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- App startup: <2 seconds to first interaction
- Tab switching: <300ms transition time
- Chat loading: <1 second for conversation history
- Video upload: Progress feedback within 100ms
- Analysis results: <30 seconds total processing time

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
```javascript
// Memory management for videos
const VideoMemoryManager = {
  preloadThumbnails: async (videoIds) => {
    // Preload only visible thumbnails
  },
  cleanupOldVideos: () => {
    // Remove cached videos older than 30 days
  },
  optimizeVideoQuality: (screenSize) => {
    // Serve appropriate video quality for device
  }
};

// Chat history optimization
const ChatOptimizer = {
  compressOldMessages: async (userId) => {
    // Compress messages older than 7 days
  },
  preloadRecentChats: async (userId) => {
    // Cache last 20 messages for instant loading
  },
  backgroundSync: async () => {
    // Sync chat updates in background
  }
};
```

LOADING OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Implement skeleton screens for loading states
- Lazy load images and videos
- Background prefetching for likely-needed content
- Progressive loading with priority queues
- Intelligent caching strategies

ANIMATION POLISH:
- Smooth tab transitions with proper easing
- Loading animations for video processing
- Success animations for completed analyses
- Progress indicators with meaningful feedback

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <TabNavigator>
    <ChatScreen />
    <SummaryScreen />
    <VideoVaultScreen />
    <ProfileScreen />
  </TabNavigator>
</ErrorBoundary>
```
