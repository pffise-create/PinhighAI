# Golf AI Analysis - Monolithic Lambda Archive

## Archive Information
- **Date**: September 5, 2025
- **File**: `golf-ai-analysis-monolithic-backup-20250904.zip`
- **Original Function**: `golf-ai-analysis`
- **Size**: 23.5 KB
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18.x

## What Was Archived
This is the complete monolithic Lambda function that handled all golf coaching functionality before the microservices rearchitecture.

### Original Function Capabilities:
- Video upload handling (`POST /api/video/analyze`)
- AI swing analysis with OpenAI GPT-4o
- Chat request handling (`POST /api/chat`) 
- Results retrieval (`GET /api/video/results/{jobId}`)
- Frame extraction triggering
- User authentication context
- DynamoDB operations
- OpenAI thread management

### Code Structure:
- **Total Lines**: ~1,800 lines
- **Responsibilities**: 7 major functions
- **Integration**: All API Gateway endpoints
- **Dependencies**: AWS SDK, OpenAI API, HTTPS requests

## Why It Was Replaced
The monolithic architecture suffered from:
- **Pipeline Issues**: 0% success rate for AI analysis
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Single point of failure
- **Deployment Complexity**: All-or-nothing deployments  
- **Scaling Limitations**: One timeout/memory configuration for all use cases
- **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to one feature affected all others

## Replacement Architecture
Replaced with focused microservices:
1. `golf-video-upload-handler` - Video upload processing
2. `golf-ai-analysis-processor` - AI analysis with OpenAI threading
3. `golf-chat-api-handler` - Chat request handling
4. `golf-results-api-handler` - Results retrieval

## Migration Completed
- **Date**: September 5, 2025
- **Status**: All API Gateway endpoints migrated successfully
- **Success Rate**: 100% (vs 0% with monolithic function)
- **User Experience**: Preserved and enhanced with unified threading

## Recovery Instructions
If rollback is needed:
1. Extract `golf-ai-analysis-monolithic-backup-20250904.zip`
2. Deploy as `golf-ai-analysis` Lambda function
3. Update API Gateway integrations to point back to monolithic function
4. Remove microservice Lambda functions

**Note**: The microservice architecture provides better reliability, debugging, and scalability.
