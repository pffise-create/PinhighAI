# Technical System Audit Report: Golf Coaching App

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**System:** React Native Mobile App + AWS Serverless Backend  
**Status:** Critical - Multiple System Failures Identified  

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings
🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**
1. **Broken Integration Pipeline**: Frame extraction completes but AI analysis never triggers
2. **Dual Frame Extractor Problem**: Working v2 extractor bypassed by failing v1 calls  
3. **Authentication Degradation**: All users defaulting to guest mode
4. **No Error Recovery**: System failures leave users in infinite loading states

### System Reliability Assessment
- **Current Uptime**: ~0% (AI analysis pipeline completely broken)
- **User Experience**: Degraded (videos upload but no coaching results)
- **Data Consistency**: At risk (orphaned records in multiple states)

### Immediate Action Required
1. Fix frame extractor invocation (AI Lambda → v2 extractor)
2. Restore authentication token flow (React Native → AWS)
3. Implement completion triggers (frame extraction → AI analysis)

├── Structure: golf-swings/{userId}/{timestamp}-{random}.mov
├── Triggers: ObjectCreated → golf-coach-frame-extractor-v2
└── ISSUE: Videos uploaded to /guest/ folder instead of real user IDs
```

**API Gateway Endpoints:**
```
https://t7y64hqkq0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
├── POST /api/video/analyze → golf-ai-analysis (trigger analysis)
├── GET /api/video/results/{jobId} → golf-ai-analysis (get results)
├── POST /api/chat → golf-ai-analysis (chat interface)
└── POST /api/video/presigned-url → presigned URL generator
```

### Lambda Function Analysis

**golf-ai-analysis (aianalysis_lambda_code.js)**
- **Lines of Code**: 1,800+ (VIOLATION: Too complex)
- **Responsibilities**: 7 different functions (VIOLATION: Multiple responsibilities)
  1. HTTP request routing
  2. Chat API handling  
  3. Video analysis orchestration
  4. Frame extraction triggering
  5. DynamoDB operations
  6. OpenAI API integration
  7. User context management
- **Timeout**: 300s (appropriate for AI processing)
- **Memory**: 512MB (may be insufficient for large context)
- **Critical Issue**: Lines 166-167 call broken frame extractor instead of working v2

**golf-coach-frame-extractor-v2 (Working Docker version)**
- **Trigger**: S3 events (direct from video uploads)
- **Processing**: Successfully extracts frames to S3
- **Critical Gap**: No mechanism to notify AI analysis of completion
- **DynamoDB Updates**: Updates status to "COMPLETED" but missing trigger for next step

### Data Architecture

**Analysis Record Flow:**
```
1. API Request → CREATE record (status: STARTED)
2. Frame Extractor v2 → UPDATE record (status: EXTRACTING_FRAMES)
3. Frame Extractor v2 → UPDATE record (status: COMPLETED)
4. [BROKEN] AI Analysis should trigger here but doesn't
5. Record remains: {status: COMPLETED, ai_analysis_completed: false}
```

**User Context Issues:**
- All requests show `userId: "guest"` instead of authenticated user IDs
- Authentication headers missing from API calls
- JWT tokens not being parsed in Lambda functions

### Error Pattern Analysis

**From Recent Logs (Analysis ID: 1756878529655-c7nxpnrgq):**

1. **05:48:52** - Video analysis triggered successfully
2. **05:48:53** - DynamoDB stream triggers AI Lambda  
3. **05:48:53** - AI Lambda calls broken frame extractor (fails with PIL error)
4. **05:48:53** - S3 event triggers working frame extractor v2 (succeeds)
5. **05:48:55** - Frame extraction completes, updates DynamoDB
6. **05:48:55+** - No AI analysis triggered (PIPELINE BROKEN)

**Common Failure Patterns:**
- PIL import errors in Python frame extractor (100% failure rate)
- Authentication degradation (all users → guest mode)
- Infinite polling loops (React Native waits for AI analysis that never starts)
- Resource leaks (Lambda containers spinning indefinitely)

## 2. React Native Frontend Audit

### App Architecture Analysis

**Navigation Structure:**
```
AppNavigator.js
├── SignInScreen (authentication entry)
├── MainTabs (4-tab interface)
│   ├── ChatScreen (primary interface)
│   ├── CoachingSummaryScreen 
│   ├── VideosScreen
│   └── ProfileScreen
└── CameraScreen (modal overlay)
```

**Service Files:**
```
src/services/
├── videoService.js (video upload + analysis orchestration)
├── chatApiService.js (AI chat communication)
└── [Missing] authenticationService.js (auth is handled in context)
```

**State Management:**
```
src/context/
├── AuthContext.js (user authentication state)
└── [Missing] VideoContext.js, ChatContext.js (local component state only)
```

### Integration Points

**API Calls Analysis:**

**videoService.js** (Lines 260-368):
- `uploadAndAnalyze()` - Core video processing function
- `waitForAnalysisComplete()` - Polling for AI results  
- **Issue**: Authentication parameters added but polling loops infinitely

**chatApiService.js** (Lines 11-80):
- `sendMessage()` - AI chat integration
- **Issue**: 15-second timeout too short for AI processing
- **Recent Fix**: Authentication headers now included

**Authentication Implementation:**
```javascript
// AuthContext.js (Lines 123-134)
const { user, isAuthenticated, getAuthHeaders } = useAuth();
const userId = user?.id || 'guest';  // ✅ Fixed: was user?.email
const authHeaders = getAuthHeaders(); // ✅ Recently added
```

**Critical Integration Gap:**
React Native successfully sends authenticated requests, but AWS Lambda extractUserContext() falls back to guest mode, indicating JWT validation issues.

### Mock vs Real Functionality

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Video recording and upload to S3
- ✅ Authentication UI and token management
- ✅ API communication layer
- ✅ Frame extraction (via S3 triggers)

**Mock/Broken Features:**
- ❌ AI coaching analysis (pipeline broken)
- ❌ User-specific coaching history (guest mode fallback)
- ❌ Real-time analysis progress (infinite polling)
- ❌ Error recovery (users stuck in loading states)

---

## 3. Critical Integration Analysis

### Authentication Flow

**Current Flow:**
```
1. React Native: AWS Amplify/Cognito authentication ✅
2. React Native: JWT token extraction ✅  
3. React Native: API calls with Authorization headers ✅
4. API Gateway: Forwards headers to Lambda ✅
5. Lambda: extractUserContext() → FAILS → defaults to guest ❌
```

**Root Cause (Lines 173-224 in aianalysis_lambda_code.js):**
The `extractUserContext()` function has JWT validation code but it's disabled:
```javascript
// Line 14: Note: JWT validation temporarily disabled due to missing dependencies
```

### Video Upload Pipeline

**Working Flow:**
```
1. React Native → API Gateway → Lambda (get presigned URL) ✅
2. React Native → S3 (direct upload via presigned URL) ✅  
3. S3 → Lambda v2 (frame extraction via S3 event) ✅
4. Lambda v2 → S3 (extracted frames) + DynamoDB (status update) ✅
```

**Broken Flow:**
```
5. DynamoDB Stream → AI Analysis Lambda ✅
6. AI Analysis Lambda → Broken Frame Extractor ❌ (should skip this step)
7. AI Analysis Lambda → OpenAI Processing ❌ (never reached)
8. Final Results → React Native ❌ (infinite polling)
```

### API Communication

**Endpoint Status:**
- `POST /api/video/analyze` - ✅ Working (creates analysis records)
- `GET /api/video/results/{jobId}` - ⚠️ Working but returns incomplete data
- `POST /api/chat` - ✅ Working (chat interface)
- `POST /api/video/presigned-url` - ✅ Working (S3 uploads)

**Missing Endpoints:**
- `DELETE /api/video/{jobId}` - Cleanup failed analyses
- `GET /api/user/history` - User-specific coaching history
- `POST /api/user/feedback` - Analysis feedback system

---

## 4. Configuration and Environment Management

### Environment Variables

**Lambda Environment Variables (golf-ai-analysis):**
```javascript
DYNAMODB_TABLE: "golf-coach-analyses" ✅
COGNITO_REGION: "us-east-1" ✅  
OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-proj-..." ✅ (present but exposed in logs)
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: "us-east-1_s9LDheoFF" ✅
USER_THREADS_TABLE: "golf-user-threads" ✅
```

**React Native Environment Variables:**
```javascript
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL: "https://t7y64hqkq0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod" ✅
// Missing: Environment-specific URLs for dev/staging
```

**Security Issues:**
- OpenAI API key appears in CloudWatch logs (Line 414 in audit logs)
- No secrets management (keys in plain environment variables)
- No API key rotation mechanism

### Deployment Architecture

**Current Deployment Process:**
```bash
# Lambda Deployment (manual via CLI)
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name golf-ai-analysis --zip-file fileb://package.zip

# React Native (Expo-based)
expo publish # or expo build
```

**Missing Infrastructure:**
- No Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- No automated deployment pipeline
- No environment promotion process
- No rollback mechanism

## 5. Performance and Cost Analysis

### Resource Utilization

**Lambda Function Efficiency:**

**golf-ai-analysis:**
- Allocated: 512MB memory, 300s timeout
- Typical Usage: ~103MB memory, 85-320ms duration
- **Issue**: Massively over-provisioned for routing operations
- **Recommendation**: Split into smaller functions (128MB sufficient for routing)

**golf-coach-frame-extractor-v2:**
- Allocated: 10GB memory (container)
- **Issue**: Extremely over-provisioned for video processing
- **Recommendation**: Optimize container image, reduce to 2-4GB

**DynamoDB:**
- Current: On-demand pricing
- Usage Pattern: Low volume, sporadic writes
- **Status**: Appropriately configured

### Cost Structure

**Monthly AWS Costs (Estimated):**
- Lambda Invocations: ~$5/month (low volume)
- Lambda Duration: ~$20/month (over-provisioned)
- DynamoDB: ~$2/month (minimal usage)
- S3 Storage: ~$10/month (video files)
- API Gateway: ~$3/month
- **Total**: ~$40/month (could be reduced to ~$20 with optimization)

### Scalability Concerns

**Current Bottlenecks:**
1. **Single-function Architecture**: golf-ai-analysis handles all operations
2. **Synchronous Processing**: No queue system for batch processing
3. **Memory Limits**: AI processing may hit 512MB limit with complex analysis
4. **Cold Starts**: Container-based functions have 10-30 second startup time

**Scaling Failure Points:**
- Concurrent video uploads could overwhelm single Lambda function
- DynamoDB streams could create processing backlogs
- No circuit breakers or retry mechanisms

---

## 6. Failure Risk Assessment

### Single Points of Failure

**Critical Dependencies:**
1. **golf-ai-analysis Lambda** - Handles all API operations (SPOF)
2. **OpenAI API** - No fallback for AI processing failures
3. **DynamoDB Streams** - Single stream for all pipeline triggers
4. **S3 Bucket** - Single bucket for all video storage

**Complex Functions Violating SRP:**
- `golf-ai-analysis` - 1,800+ lines, 7 different responsibilities
- `extractUserContext()` - JWT validation, DynamoDB parsing, fallback logic
- `handleVideoAnalysis()` - Orchestrates entire video pipeline

### Error Recovery

**Current Error Handling:**
- ❌ React Native: No timeout recovery (infinite polling)
- ⚠️ Lambda: Basic try-catch with fallback responses  
- ❌ Pipeline: No retry mechanism for failed analyses
- ❌ User Experience: No error reporting (users see eternal loading)

**Missing Monitoring:**
- No CloudWatch dashboards
- No error alerting
- No performance metrics
- No user experience tracking

### Data Consistency Risks

**Orphaned Records:**
- Analysis records stuck in "COMPLETED" status without AI results
- Video files in S3 without corresponding analysis records
- User authentication state not synchronized with backend

**Race Conditions:**
- Multiple DynamoDB stream events could trigger duplicate processing
- S3 events and Lambda invocations could create timing conflicts

## 7. Rearchitecture Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Priority 1 - Critical)

**1. Fix Frame Extractor Pipeline (Estimated: 2 hours)**
```javascript
// File: AWS/aianalysis_lambda_code.js, Lines 160-170
// CHANGE: Update function invocation to use working v2 extractor
const lambdaClient = getLambdaClient();
await lambdaClient.invoke({
  FunctionName: 'golf-coach-frame-extractor-v2',  // Change from 'golf-coach-frame-extractor'
  InvocationType: 'Event',
  Payload: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
```

**2. Enable JWT Token Validation (Estimated: 3 hours)**
```javascript
// File: AWS/aianalysis_lambda_code.js, Line 14
// REMOVE: "JWT validation temporarily disabled" comment and enable validation
// ADD: Proper JWT library dependencies to deployment package
```

**3. Add AI Analysis Completion Trigger (Estimated: 4 hours)**
```javascript
// File: golf-coach-frame-extractor-v2 Lambda
// ADD: After successful frame extraction, trigger AI analysis
// Method: Invoke golf-ai-analysis with completed frame data
```

### Structural Improvements (Priority 2 - High)

**1. Decompose Monolithic Lambda (Estimated: 8 hours)**
