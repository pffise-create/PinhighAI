hanks for sharing the swing sequence. Based on the five frames, here’s a breakdown of key observations and actionable feedback for your driver swing:

🟩 Setup (Last Frame)

    Positives:

        Good athletic posture with slight knee flex.

        Spine tilt away from target is appropriate for driver setup.

        Feet are planted and aligned well.

    Areas to Watch:

        Your head looks slightly pushed forward over the ball. You might benefit from a little more spine tilt to encourage an upward angle of attack.

🟨 Top of Backswing (Third Frame)

    Positives:

        Great width — right arm is extended.

        Shoulder turn is solid — left shoulder is under your chin.

    Areas to Watch:

        The clubface appears slightly shut (toe pointing toward the sky, not fully vertical). This could lead to a draw bias or a hook if your sequencing isn’t perfect.

        There’s a hint of laid-off shaft position (club pointing left of target), which can encourage over-the-top if not managed well in transition.

🟧 Transition & Downswing (Fourth Frame)

    Positives:

        Hands are staying in front of the chest — you’re not casting.

        Solid forward bend and athletic posture are maintained.

    Areas to Watch:

        Club is steep here — shaft angle is too vertical, which might cause pulls or slices, especially with driver.

        This could result from a lack of lower body initiation or from early arm dominance. It also aligns with that laid-off position at the top.

🟥 Impact (Second Frame)

    Positives:

        Great weight transfer — you’re into your lead side.

        Hands are leading the clubhead slightly — not flipping.

    Areas to Watch:

        Hips could be more open at impact. They look square-ish here, suggesting rotational sequencing could be improved.

        Head still looks a little forward, which may hurt launch angle and contact with the driver.

🟦 Follow Through (First Frame)

    Positives:

        Nice high finish with good balance — you’re rotating through well.

    Areas to Watch:

        There’s a bit of “chicken winging” in the lead arm, suggesting some tension or stalled rotation through the ball.

        Make sure your chest continues to rotate fully through — feel like you’re “covering” the ball more with your chest.

🎯 Prioritized Fixes


If you’re looking to tighten things up, start here:

    Fix Club Path/Face at the Top: Work on a more neutral (not laid-off) position at the top. Try slow-mo backswing drills with a mirror or video.

    Shallow the Club in Transition: Feel like the handle stays high while the clubhead shallows behind you. “Pump and reroute” drills or the “split-hand drill” can help.

    Open the Hips Earlier: Try a “step drill” to train earlier lower-body rotation.

    Relax the Arms at Finish: Work on extension through the ball to avoid the chicken wing. Feel like your arms “chase” the ball out toward the target.

Would you like a set of drills tailored to shallowing the club or syncing lower body rotation? I can also overlay swing lines if you’d like to send a face-on view next.
