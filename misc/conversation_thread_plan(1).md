# Golf Coaching App - Revised Implementation Plan
## User-Level Conversation Thread Architecture

### Current Problem
- Each API call sends ALL frames + conversation history = expensive & slow
- No persistent conversation memory between requests
- Generic responses instead of conversational coaching
- **Need cross-swing comparisons**: "Is this swing better than my last one?"

### Solution: Single User Thread + Unified Message Types
1. **One conversation thread per user** - handles both video analysis and chat messages
2. **Video upload** → Adds swing analysis message to user thread → AI coaching response  
3. **Chat message** → Adds user question to same thread → AI continues coaching conversation
4. **Frame curation per swing** - only keep 6-8 key frames from each video analysis
5. **Seamless flow** - user never thinks about "video mode" vs "chat mode"
6. **OpenAI auto-truncation** handles conversation length automatically
7. **Cross-swing coaching**: "Your latest swing vs two weeks ago" naturally supported

### Unified User Experience Flow
```
User Thread (thread_user456):
├── [VIDEO] Swing Analysis 1 + AI coaching response
├── [CHAT] "Tell me more about my grip" + AI response
├── [CHAT] "What drills should I practice?" + AI response  
├── [VIDEO] Swing Analysis 2 + AI coaching response
├── [CHAT] "Is this swing better than my last one?" + AI response
├── [VIDEO] Swing Analysis 3 + AI coaching response
└── [CHAT] "How much have I improved overall?" + AI response
```

## STEP 1: Replace Swing Analysis with User Threading (Priority 1)
**File**: `aianalysis_lambda_code.js`  
**Functions to Replace**: `analyzeSwingWithGPT4o` (line ~1079) and `selectKeyFramesForAnalysis` (lines 1316-1340)

**Claude Code Prompt for Step 1:**
```
Replace swing analysis functions in aianalysis_lambda_code.js to implement unified user threading with frame curation.

SPECIFIC CODE CHANGES REQUIRED:

1. DELETE COMPLETELY:
   - `selectKeyFramesForAnalysis` function (lines 1316-1340)
   - All calls to `selectKeyFramesForAnalysis()` throughout the file
   - Replace those calls with direct use of `frameData.frame_urls`

2. REPLACE ENTIRELY:
   - `analyzeSwingWithGPT4o(frameData, swingData)` function (starts around line 1079)
   - Replace with new function that implements user thread management

3. NEW FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS:
   ```javascript
   async function analyzeSwingWithGPT4o(frameData, swingData) {
     // 1. Extract userId from swingData
     // 2. Check for existing user thread: getUserThread(userId)
     // 3. If no thread exists, create new OpenAI thread with coaching system prompt
     // 4. Send ALL frames from frameData.frame_urls to existing/new thread
     // 5. Enhanced prompt: "Analyze this swing and identify 6-8 key frames. Reference previous swings if this helps with progression."
     // 6. Parse response to extract coaching text + key frame list
     // 7. Use OpenAI Threads API to delete non-key frame messages immediately
     // 8. Update user thread metadata with new swing analysis
     // 9. Return coaching response for immediate display
   }
   ```

4. INTEGRATION POINTS:
   - Function should call new helper functions: `getUserThread()`, `storeUserThread()`
   - Function should work with existing `storeAIAnalysis()` for response storage
   - Function should maintain existing error handling patterns
   - Function should work with existing DynamoDB table structure

5. FRAME CURATION LOGIC:
   - Send all frames initially for comprehensive analysis
   - Parse GPT response to extract key frame IDs
   - Delete non-key frame messages using OpenAI Threads API
   - Store key frame references in user thread metadata

Show me the complete replacement code that deletes selectKeyFramesForAnalysis and replaces analyzeSwingWithGPT4o with user threading + frame curation.
```

---

## STEP 2: Replace Chat Handler for User Thread Continuation (Priority 1) 
**File**: `aianalysis_lambda_code.js`  
**Function to Replace**: `handleChatRequest` (starts around line 1557)

**Claude Code Prompt for Step 2:**
```
Replace the handleChatRequest function in aianalysis_lambda_code.js to continue user conversation threads instead of isolated chat responses.

SPECIFIC CODE CHANGES REQUIRED:

1. FIND AND REPLACE ENTIRELY:
   - `handleChatRequest(event, userContext)` function (starts around line 1557)
   - Keep the function signature but replace all internal logic

2. DELETE FROM EXISTING FUNCTION:
   - Any code that tries to assemble conversation context from multiple sources
   - Complex context assembly logic (assembleEnhancedFollowUpContext, etc.)
   - Rate limiting complexity beyond basic user identification
   - Any attempts to send frames or rebuild context

3. NEW FUNCTION LOGIC:
   ```javascript
   async function handleChatRequest(event, userContext) {
     // 1. Parse request body to extract: message, userId
     // 2. Validate userId exists and apply basic rate limiting
     // 3. Get user's existing thread: getUserThread(userId)
     // 4. If no thread exists, create general coaching thread (no swing context)
     // 5. Add user's message to their OpenAI thread
     // 6. Call OpenAI API with thread continuation (no additional context needed)
     // 7. Parse AI response and return formatted result
     // 8. Update thread metadata (last_updated, message_count)
   }
   ```

4. SIMPLIFICATIONS TO MAKE:
   - Remove jobId/analysisId handling (user thread contains all swing context)
   - Remove conversation history assembly (OpenAI thread maintains this)
   - Remove complex context switching between swing-specific and general chat
   - Remove token counting and management (OpenAI handles auto-truncation)

5. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Must use same getUserThread() and storeUserThread() helpers as Step 1
   - Must work with existing error handling and response formatting
   - Must maintain existing CORS headers and response structure
   - Must integrate with existing rate limiting user identification

6. UNIFIED EXPERIENCE:
   - This function continues the SAME thread that analyzeSwingWithGPT4o uses
   - No distinction between "swing chat" and "general chat" - all one conversation
   - AI naturally references recent swing uploads from thread context

Show me the complete replacement handleChatRequest function that implements simple user thread continuation.
```

## STEP 3: Add New User Thread Management Functions (Priority 2)
**File**: `aianalysis_lambda_code.js`  
**Location**: Add after existing DynamoDB helper functions (around line 2000+)

**Claude Code Prompt for Step 3:**
```
Add new user thread management functions to aianalysis_lambda_code.js for OpenAI conversation thread storage and retrieval.

SPECIFIC CODE ADDITIONS REQUIRED:

1. ADD NEW FUNCTIONS (place after existing DynamoDB functions around line 2000):

```javascript
// Get or create user's conversation thread
async function getUserThread(userId) {
  // 1. Query DynamoDB for existing user thread record
  // 2. If exists, return { thread_id, swing_count, created_at }
  // 3. If not exists, create new OpenAI thread with coaching system prompt
  // 4. Store new thread mapping in DynamoDB
  // 5. Return new thread data
}

// Store/update user thread information
async function storeUserThread(userId, threadData) {
  // 1. Update or create DynamoDB record with thread mapping
  // 2. Include: user_id, thread_id, swing_analyses array, last_updated
  // 3. Use existing DynamoDB table with new fields
}

// Add swing analysis metadata to user's record
async function addSwingToUserHistory(userId, swingMetadata) {
  // 1. Update user's DynamoDB record to add swing to swing_analyses array
  // 2. Include: analysis_id, date, key_frames list, coaching_focus
  // 3. Update total swing count and last_updated timestamp
}
```

2. DYNAMODB TABLE MODIFICATIONS:
   - Use existing table name: process.env.DYNAMODB_TABLE || 'golf-coach-analyses'
   - Add new record type for user threads with partition key format: `user_{userId}`
   - Store thread mapping data alongside existing swing analysis records

3. NEW RECORD STRUCTURE TO STORE:
   ```json
   {
     "analysis_id": "user_456",  // Using analysis_id as partition key for consistency
     "record_type": "user_thread",
     "user_id": "user_456", 
     "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
     "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
     "swing_analyses": [
       {
         "analysis_id": "swing_001",
         "date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z", 
         "key_frames": ["frame_005", "frame_012"],
         "coaching_focus": "backswing plane"
       }
     ],
     "last_updated": "2024-01-20T15:30:00Z",
     "total_swings": 1
   }
   ```

4. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Functions must work with existing DynamoDB client: getDynamoClient()
   - Functions must use existing error handling patterns
   - Functions must be called by the updated analyzeSwingWithGPT4o and handleChatRequest
   - Functions must handle both authenticated and guest users

5. OPENAI THREAD CREATION:
   - Use OpenAI Threads API to create new conversation threads
   - Include coaching system prompt that establishes ongoing relationship
   - Return thread_id for storage and future use

Show me the complete implementation of these three new functions with proper DynamoDB integration and OpenAI thread management.
```

## STEP 4: Update Mobile App Request Handling (Priority 2)
**Files**: `ChatScreen.js` and `chatApiService.js`  
**Specific Changes**: Request payload and UI modifications

**Claude Code Prompt for Step 4:**
```
Update React Native mobile app files to support unified user thread conversations with proper userId handling.

SPECIFIC FILE CHANGES REQUIRED:

1. IN chatApiService.js - UPDATE sendMessage FUNCTION:

FIND AND REPLACE:
- Current request payload that may include jobId, conversationHistory, or complex context
- Replace with simple payload: { message, userId }

NEW REQUEST FORMAT:
```javascript
// In chatApiService.js sendMessage function
const requestPayload = {
  message: message.trim(),
  userId: userId,  // Always include userId for thread continuity
  // Remove: jobId, conversationHistory, swingContext - backend handles this now
};
```

REMOVE FROM chatApiService.js:
- formatConversationHistory() function (if it exists)
- formatCoachingContext() function (if it exists) 
- Any complex context assembly logic

2. IN ChatScreen.js - UPDATE MESSAGE SENDING:

FIND AND REPLACE:
- Any code that tries to send conversation history or swing context
- Any code that switches between "swing mode" and "chat mode"

SIMPLIFY TO:
```javascript
// In ChatScreen.js sendMessage function
const result = await chatApiService.sendMessage(
  userMessage.text,
  userId  // Only send message and userId - backend handles thread continuity
  // Remove: conversationHistory, coachingContext, jobId parameters
);
```

3. OPTIONAL UI ENHANCEMENTS TO ADD:

ADD to ChatScreen.js:
```javascript
// Optional: Show ongoing coaching relationship status
const [coachingSessionInfo, setCoachingSessionInfo] = useState(null);

// Optional: Display swing count or coaching session number
<Text style={styles.sessionInfo}>
  Coaching Session #{coachingSessionInfo?.totalSwings || 1}
</Text>
```

4. REMOVE FROM MOBILE APP:
- Any logic that tries to determine "current swing context"
- Any UI that switches between video-specific and general chat modes
- Any complex context assembly or conversation history management
- Any jobId or analysisId passing in chat requests

5. SIMPLIFIED USER FLOW:
- User always just types messages and sends them with userId
- Backend handles all thread continuity automatically
- No need for app to track conversation state or swing context

Show me the specific code changes needed in chatApiService.js and ChatScreen.js to implement simple userId-based threading.
```

---

## STEP 5: Clean Up Unused Code (Cleanup)
**File**: `aianalysis_lambda_code.js`  
**Code to Remove**: Unused functions and complex context logic

**Claude Code Prompt for Step 5:**
```
Remove unused functions and simplify aianalysis_lambda_code.js now that user threading eliminates complex context management.

SPECIFIC DELETIONS REQUIRED:

1. DELETE THESE FUNCTIONS COMPLETELY (if they exist):
   - `selectKeyFramesForAnalysis()` - Already deleted in Step 1, verify removal
   - `assembleEnhancedFollowUpContext()` - No longer needed with user threads
   - `buildEnhancedGolfCoachingPrompt()` - Replace with simple system prompt
   - Any complex conversation context assembly functions
   - Any functions that try to rebuild conversation history from multiple sources

2. FIND AND SIMPLIFY:
   - `buildUnifiedCoachingPrompt()` function - Simplify to basic system prompt only
   - Remove complex context assembly logic within this function
   - Keep only the core coaching personality prompt

   REPLACE WITH SIMPLE VERSION:
   ```javascript
   function buildUnifiedCoachingPrompt() {
     return `You are a professional golf coach having an ongoing conversation with this golfer. 

     COACHING APPROACH:
     - Be conversational and encouraging like a real coach
     - Reference specific positions you see in swing videos when relevant
     - Build on previous coaching points and swing analyses naturally
     - Give actionable advice, not just observations
     - Track the golfer's improvement over time

     Remember: You have access to their complete swing progression and previous coaching conversations in this thread.`;
   }
   ```

3. REMOVE FROM EXISTING FUNCTIONS:
   - Any remaining calls to `selectKeyFramesForAnalysis()` - Replace with direct use of `frameData.frame_urls`
   - Complex rate limiting beyond basic user identification
   - Token counting and management logic (OpenAI handles auto-truncation)
   - Multiple conversation storage attempts (user thread is single source of truth)

4. SIMPLIFY HELPER FUNCTIONS:
   - `parseGPT4oResponse()` - Simplify to just return coaching text, remove complex parsing
   - `storeAIAnalysis()` - Keep for backward compatibility but thread is primary storage
   - Remove any functions that try to assemble context from multiple DynamoDB queries

5. VERIFY REMOVAL OF:
   - All references to per-swing conversation threads
   - jobId/analysisId-based thread lookups (replaced with userId-based)
   - Complex conversation history assembly from multiple sources
   - Frame selection algorithms (we send all frames, GPT curates)

Show me the cleanup code that removes these unused functions and simplifies the remaining context management logic.
```

## STEP 6: Add Markdown Rendering to Mobile App (Quick Win)
**Files**: React Native message display components  
**Changes**: Install package and replace Text components

**Claude Code Prompt for Step 6:**
```
Add markdown rendering to React Native mobile app to properly display AI coaching responses with formatting.

SPECIFIC CHANGES REQUIRED:

1. INSTALL MARKDOWN PACKAGE:
```bash
npm install react-native-markdown-display
# or
yarn add react-native-markdown-display
```

2. FIND MESSAGE DISPLAY COMPONENTS:
   - Look for components that display AI coaching responses (likely in ChatScreen.js or MessageComponent.js)
   - Find Text components that show AI message content
   - Identify where AI responses are rendered with raw markdown (### symbols, **bold**, etc.)

3. REPLACE TEXT COMPONENTS:

FIND code that looks like:
```javascript
// Current - shows raw markdown
<Text style={styles.aiMessage}>
  {message.text}
</Text>
```

REPLACE WITH:
```javascript
// New - renders markdown formatting
import Markdown from 'react-native-markdown-display';

<Markdown 
  style={markdownStyles}
  mergeStyle={true}
>
  {message.text}
</Markdown>
```

4. ADD MARKDOWN STYLES:
```javascript
const markdownStyles = {
  heading1: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#2d5016', // Golf green
    marginVertical: 8,
  },
  heading2: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold', 
    color: '#2d5016',
    marginVertical: 6,
  },
  heading3: {
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#2d5016',
    marginVertical: 4,
  },
  strong: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#000',
  },
  em: {
    fontStyle: 'italic',
  },
  list_item: {
    marginVertical: 2,
  },
  body: {
    fontSize: 14,
    lineHeight: 20,
    color: '#333',
  }
};
```

5. IMPORT REQUIREMENTS:
   - Add Markdown import to any components that display AI responses
   - Ensure markdown styles integrate with existing app theme
   - Test with typical AI responses containing headers, bold text, and lists

6. TESTING EXAMPLES:
   Test markdown rendering with these AI response formats:
   - "### Key Swing Issues"
   - "**Focus Area**: Backswing plane"  
   - "*Practice this drill*: Slow motion swings"
   - Numbered lists and bullet points

Show me the specific file changes needed to replace Text components with Markdown components for AI message rendering.
```

## Success Metrics After Implementation

### Technical Improvements
- **90% cost reduction** on follow-up conversations (no frame re-uploading)
- **80% memory reduction** after frame curation (50 frames → 6-8 key frames)
- **Faster response times** for chat (only new message sent to OpenAI)
- **Natural conversation flow** - AI references previous coaching points and specific frames
- **No token management complexity** - OpenAI handles truncation automatically

### User Experience Improvements  
- **"Tell me more about my backswing"** → AI references specific key frames from analysis
- **Conversational coaching** instead of clinical responses
- **Proper text formatting** in mobile app responses
- **Seamless long conversations** - user never experiences truncation interruptions
- **Frame-specific coaching** - AI can reference "your position in frame 15"

### Cost Analysis with User Threading + Frame Curation
```
Before Implementation (Current):
- Each follow-up sends all frames: ~50,000 tokens per question
- 10 follow-up questions: ~500,000 tokens total per swing
- No conversation memory or cross-swing context

After Implementation (User Threading + Frame Curation):
- Swing Analysis 1: ~50,000 tokens → curated to ~8,000 tokens (6-8 key frames)
- Swing Analysis 2: ~50,000 tokens → curated to ~8,000 tokens (6-8 key frames)  
- Swing Analysis 3: ~50,000 tokens → curated to ~8,000 tokens (6-8 key frames)
- 20 follow-up questions across all swings: ~700 tokens each = ~14,000 tokens total
- Cross-swing comparisons: Same cost as regular questions (no frame re-uploading)

Total for 3 swings + 20 coaching conversations:
- Before: ~1,500,000 tokens (3 × 500K per swing)
- After: ~164,000 tokens (150K analysis + 24K curated + 14K conversations)  
- **89% cost reduction** with superior coaching quality and cross-swing comparisons

Additional Benefits:
- AI can track improvement over months: "Your swing has progressed significantly"
- Cross-swing coaching: "This is your best impact position yet"
- Coaching relationship builds over time
- User gets comprehensive swing development program
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: New swing analysis adds to user's ongoing coaching thread
- [ ] Step 1: Frame curation works - non-key frames deleted, thread memory reduced by 80%
- [ ] Step 2: Follow-up questions continue user's coaching thread with full context
- [ ] Step 2: Cross-swing questions work: "Is this better than my last swing?"
- [ ] Step 3: User thread data stored and retrieved correctly from DynamoDB  
- [ ] Step 4: Mobile app sends userId for thread continuation in all chat requests
- [ ] Step 5: Old per-swing frame selection code removed safely
- [ ] Step 6: AI responses show proper formatting in mobile app
- [ ] Cross-swing coaching: AI can compare multiple swing analyses naturally
- [ ] Progression tracking: AI references improvement over time
- [ ] Long conversations work seamlessly with OpenAI auto-truncation
- [ ] AI can reference specific frames from any swing in user's history
- [ ] Coaching relationship builds over multiple swing analyses

### Key Benefits of User-Level Threading
- **Cross-swing comparisons**: "Your backswing improved since last month"
- **Coaching progression**: AI tracks development over time
- **Relationship building**: Genuine coaching continuity across sessions  
- **89% cost reduction** with superior coaching quality
- **Natural conversation flow**: No need to re-establish context

### User Experience Example - Unified Video + Chat Flow
```
Week 1:
[VIDEO UPLOAD] User uploads first swing video
→ AI: "Great swing! I can see solid fundamentals. Let's focus on your grip position..."
→ (Internal: Creates user thread, adds swing analysis with 6 key frames)

[CHAT MESSAGE] User: "Tell me more about the grip issue"
→ AI: "Looking at your grip in frame 8, I notice your left hand position..."
→ (Internal: Continues same thread, references frames from recent swing)

[CHAT MESSAGE] User: "What drills should I practice?"
→ AI: "Based on your swing analysis, try these grip drills..."

Week 2:
[VIDEO UPLOAD] User uploads second swing video  
→ AI: "Nice improvement! Your grip looks much better than last week. Now I notice your backswing plane..."
→ (Internal: Adds new swing analysis to same thread, curates frames, can compare to previous swing)

[CHAT MESSAGE] User: "Is this swing better than my first one?"
→ AI: "Absolutely! Comparing this swing to last week, your grip improved significantly and..."
→ (Internal: AI references both swing analyses from same thread naturally)

[CHAT MESSAGE] User: "What should I focus on next?"
→ AI: "Given your progress from grip improvement, let's work on backswing plane..."

Week 3:
[VIDEO UPLOAD] User uploads third swing video
→ AI: "Excellent progression! Over these three sessions, I can see consistent improvement..."
→ (Internal: AI has full coaching context and can track development over time)
```

**Key Point**: User never thinks "am I in video mode or chat mode?" - it's all one continuous coaching conversation where videos and messages flow naturally together.
